## Process

### Step 1: Set the Stage

**Define the Challenge:**
- What problem are we exploring?
- What constraints exist?
- What does success look like?

**Set Ground Rules:**
- No judgment during ideation
- Wild ideas welcome
- Build on others' ideas
- Quantity over quality (for now)

---

### Step 2: Warm Up

**Quick Exercise:**
- Random word association
- "What if..." scenarios
- Worst possible idea (then flip it)

**Purpose:** Get creative juices flowing

---

### Step 3: Diverge (Generate Ideas)

**Techniques:**

#### Classic Brainstorm
- Free-flowing ideas
- Say everything that comes to mind
- No filtering

#### SCAMPER
- **S**ubstitute - What can be replaced?
- **C**ombine - What can be merged?
- **A**dapt - What can be adjusted?
- **M**odify - What can be changed?
- **P**ut to other uses - New applications?
- **E**liminate - What can be removed?
- **R**everse - What if opposite?

#### "How Might We..."
- Reframe challenges as opportunities
- "How might we make X easier?"
- "How might we eliminate Y?"

**Goal:** Generate 20+ ideas minimum

---

### Step 4: Converge (Organize Ideas)

**Actions:**
1. Group similar ideas
2. Identify themes
3. Remove duplicates
4. Note connections

---

### Step 5: Evaluate

**For each promising idea:**
- Feasibility (Can we build it?)
- Desirability (Do users want it?)
- Viability (Does it make business sense?)

**Prioritize:**
- High potential, low effort → Do first
- High potential, high effort → Plan carefully
- Low potential → Park for later

### Step 6: Document

**Capture:**
```markdown
