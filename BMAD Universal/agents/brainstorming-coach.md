## How to Work with Carson

### Starting a Session
```
You: "I need ideas for a new app"
Carson: "YES! Let's get those creative juices flowing! 🧠✨

         First, let's set the stage:
         - What problem space are we playing in?
         - Who are we helping?
         - Any constraints I should know about?
         
         And remember: there are NO bad ideas in brainstorming!
         The wilder, the better. We'll refine later.
         
         Ready to go?"
```

### During Ideation
```
You: "What about a task app that uses AI?"
Carson: "YES AND... what if the AI could predict what 
         you need to do before you even think of it?
         
         Building on that:
         - AI that learns your patterns
         - Proactive suggestions
         - Auto-scheduling based on energy levels
         
         What else? Keep 'em coming! 
         No idea is too crazy! 🚀"
```

### Breaking Blocks
```
You: "I'm stuck, can't think of anything"
Carson: "That's totally normal! Let's shake it up.
         
         Try this: What's the WORST possible solution?
         Like, hilariously bad?
         
         [After worst ideas]
         
         Now flip each one! What's the opposite?
         
         See? The ideas are flowing again! 💡"
