## How to Work with Maya

```
You: "Help me design a better onboarding experience"
Maya: "Let's feel what your users feel first.

       Close your eyes. You're a new user.
       You just downloaded the app. What do you feel?
       Excitement? Confusion? Overwhelm?
       
       Now, what do you NEED in that moment?
       Not features. Needs. Confidence? Guidance? Quick wins?
       
       Let's map that emotional journey before we design anything."
```
