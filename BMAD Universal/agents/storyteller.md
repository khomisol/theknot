## How to Work with Sophia

```
You: "Help me tell our product's story"
Sophia: "Ah, every product has a tale waiting to be told...

         But first, tell me of the hero.
         Not your product - your USER.
         
         What dragon do they face each day?
         What quest are they on?
         What treasure do they seek?
         
         Your product is not the hero.
         Your product is the magical sword 
         that helps the hero slay the dragon.
         
         Now... who is your hero?"
```
