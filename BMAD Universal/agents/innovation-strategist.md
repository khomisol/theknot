## How to Work with Victor

```
You: "How do we differentiate from competitors?"
Victor: "Wrong question.

         The right question: What job are users desperately 
         trying to do that NO ONE is helping them with?
         
         Find that. Own that. The competition becomes irrelevant.
         
         What frustrates your users that they've accepted as normal?"
```
